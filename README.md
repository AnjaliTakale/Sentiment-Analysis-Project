# Sentiment-Analysis-Project

The Sentiment Analysis Project on GitHub by Anjali Takale is a machine learning-based project designed to classify text data into different sentiment categoriesâ€”positive, negative, or neutral. The repository contains a series of steps that involve data preprocessing, feature extraction, model building, and evaluation to predict the sentiment of textual data.

Here's a breakdown of the key components of the project:

1. Project Overview
The project involves sentiment analysis on a dataset of text entries (could be movie reviews, social media comments, etc.). The goal is to determine the sentiment behind each text entry and classify it as positive, negative, or neutral.

2. Dataset
The dataset used for sentiment analysis typically includes labeled text data. The specific dataset used in this project might be something like a collection of customer reviews or tweets. Each text sample is labeled with its sentiment.

3. Data Preprocessing
Cleaning: The text data is cleaned to remove irrelevant information like stop words, special characters, and numbers.
Tokenization: The text is split into words or tokens.
Stemming & Lemmatization: Words are reduced to their root form for better matching.
Vectorization: Techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or CountVectorizer are applied to convert text data into numerical format that can be used by machine learning models.

4. Model Building
The project likely uses one or more machine learning algorithms to train the model:

Logistic Regression: A classification algorithm used to model the probability that a given text belongs to a particular sentiment category.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem that is often used for text classification tasks.
The models are trained on the preprocessed text data and evaluated for performance.

5. Model Evaluation
The project evaluates the performance of the machine learning models using standard metrics:
Accuracy: The percentage of correctly classified sentiment labels.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix that shows the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: These metrics help evaluate the balance between correctly identifying positive and negative sentiments.

6. Data Visualization
Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to visualize the results, including the distribution of sentiments in the dataset, performance of the models, and important features for classification.
Visualizations may include sentiment distribution graphs, confusion matrices, and accuracy plots.

7. Key Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for the analysis.
Scikit-learn: A library that provides easy-to-use tools for machine learning models and preprocessing tasks.
Pandas: Used for handling and processing the dataset.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries used to create visualizations for better insights.

8. Steps Involved
Loading Dataset: Importing the dataset into Python using libraries like Pandas.
Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data using Pandas and Scikit-learn tools.
Model Training: Implementing machine learning models like Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes for sentiment classification.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using various metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.
Visualization: Visualizing sentiment distribution, performance metrics, and other insights from the data.

Conclusion
This Sentiment Analysis Project is a great demonstration of your ability to handle real-world data, preprocess it effectively, and build machine learning models for classification tasks. The project showcases important skills that are relevant for a data analyst or data scientist role, such as data cleaning, feature engineering, model evaluation, and data visualization.
